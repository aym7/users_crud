# User Administration


Use PostgreSQL as the database backend

Use Python 3.x

Please implement a small Django application to manage (CRUD) users and their bank account data (IBAN).

Required fields are first name, last name and IBAN.
Data should be validated.

Administrators of the app should authenticate using a Google account

Administrators should be able to create, read, update and delete users

Restrict manipulation operations on a user to the administrator who created them

Write documentation on how to setup, run and use your implementation

Test environment

Set up a virtual machine environment using docker-compose to run the test task including some short documentation

Please build the application in small logical steps and commit each step to a Github repository so that we can see how you approach the task.

Make use of any libraries and third party apps that you think might be of use here.

It would be great if you could send us your solution until beginning of next week.
Or alternatively let us know when it is feasible for you to send us back your task.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact David Lopez (david.lopez@rindus.de) if you have any technical questions.

We prefer a clean and well thought solution over a fast one.

 

All the best and happy coding!
